## Titration-Calculator
This Python script is a Titration Calculator that allows you to perform acid-base titrations and calculate the pH at various points during the titration process. It's a useful tool for chemistry students and professionals to understand how the pH of a solution changes as an acid or base is added.

##Features
-Perform acid-base titrations with ease.
-Calculate pH at different stages of the titration.
-Visualize the gradual pH change with a plot.

###Usage
1 Clone this repository to your local machine.
2 Run the titration_calculator.py script using a Python interpreter.
3 Choose one of the following options:

-Base Titrant (Titration of Acid)
-Acid Titrant (Titration of Base)
-Acid Mixture
-Base Mixture
4 Follow the on-screen prompts to input the required information, such as volumes and concentrations of the titrant and analyte.
5 The program will calculate and display the pH at each point in the titration process.
6 For acid-base mixtures, the program will directly calculate and display the pH.
7 The program will generate a plot showing the gradual change in pH throughout the titration process.
